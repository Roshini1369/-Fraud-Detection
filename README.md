 Fraud Detection
 Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
🔍 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using supervised machine learning techniques. Fraud detection plays a crucial role in securing financial systems by identifying anomalies and preventing deceptive activities in real-time.

The model is trained on a dataset of historical transactions, learning to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent behavior based on key patterns and attributes.

📊 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Contains anonymized features (V1–V28), along with Time, Amount, and a Class label (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraud).

🧠 Key Features
Anomaly Detection: Identifies deviations from normal transaction behavior.

Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

(Optional) Neural Network using Keras/TensorFlow or PyTorch

Feature Engineering: Scales and selects relevant features to improve model accuracy.

Evaluation Metrics: ROC-AUC, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall

Real-time Readiness: Structure is designed to be extended for real-time fraud detection.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data handling

Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

✅ Project Goals
Train and evaluate multiple models for fraud detection.

Address class imbalance issues (e.g., using stratified sampling).

Visualize data distribution and model performance.

Provide a baseline for future integration into real-time fraud prevention systems.
